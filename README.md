# ME-305---MCUs-and-Assembly-Programming
Introduction to MCUs and assembly language programming. Components and techniques for interfacing that are typical of embedded MCU applications (A/D conversion, D/A conversion, interrupts, timers, and PWM). Laboratory exercises involve real-time interfacing of microcontrollers to external mechanical and/or electromechanical devices.
